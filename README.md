# C-Programs
## C Programming Practice


**Program 1** - Variable basics, getting started with printf and scanf statements. Printing "Hello World".


**Program 2** - Arrays
            Getting started with Arrays. Programs for the following tasks:
1. printing the first array element along with the rest of the array using a for loop
2. taking an array index as input from the user and printing the element at that index in that array
3. storing and printing a string, which is essentially a character array, and then printing array elements at even indexes
            
      
**Program 3** - Structures
            Introduction to structures - creating and using structures to store information. Programs written for:
1. creating a database of vehicles by storing information like:
   - name
   - manufacturing year
   - cost
   - category (high end (H) / middle (M) / low end (L))
2. making two functions: one takes user input, the other prints it.
 
 
**Program 4** - Pointers
            Getting familiarized with pointers - differentiating them from regular variables; using * and & to denote pointers and memory address locations. Programs                                                      written for:
1. creating a variable, then creating a pointer to point to the memory address of the variable, printing both variable values
            
            
**Program 5** - Stacks: character not getting accepted in do-while loop, check and fix.
